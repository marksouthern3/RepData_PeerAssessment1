## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r loadingData, echo=TRUE}
# loading data
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) { unzip("activity.zip") }
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# preprocessing data
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r meanTotSteps, echo=TRUE}
daySteps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(daySteps, breaks = 10, main = "", xlab = "Steps taken per day")
mean(daySteps)
median(daySteps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r averageDailyActivity, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
meanIntSteps <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(meanSteps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
plot(meanIntSteps, type = 'l', ylab = "Average steps", xlab = "Time interval")
meanIntSteps$interval[which.max(meanIntSteps$meanSteps)]
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
